# Time-Series

Objectives:
1.	Develop a Time series model
2.	Fit time series datasets
3.	Preprocess datasets
4.	Visualize results
5.	Smoothing time series data
6.	Use the model for prediction
7.	Report findings


You need to find a suitable data source and import it to your project.
Instructions:
You need to answer the following questions:
Part 1: How has unemployment rate changed over the last twenty years and
Part 2: How does it compare to the national unemployment rate? 
Part 1:
1.	Find a suitable data source and import it to your project: the dataset should represent around 20 years period. For example it can be from 1990 to 2010 or from 2000 to 2020.
2.	Import the datasets and do the required python library setup
3.	Clean the datasets and rename columns if required
4.	Use months as labels to plot the data. If the month names are too long, use abbreviations.
5.	In the plot, mark where the unemployment was at its highest point and explain it (explain why: e.g. was there any economic problems, recessions ... etc.)
6.	Plot how the unemployment rate changed over time. Is there any trend?
